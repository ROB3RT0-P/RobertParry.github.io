Portfolio of Programming work by Robert J Parry

This is my portfolio, a mixture of text and imagies, article-oriented design built around a huge background
image and scroll effects (powered by Scrollex). 

Demo images courtesy of Unsplash, a radtastic collection of CC0 (public domain) images
you can use for pretty much whatever.
